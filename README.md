# MOTIVATION OF PROJECT

Many different types of breast cancer show relatively few signs and symptoms, and the inconspicuous nature of this disease only exacerbates the danger. 1 in 8 women in the United States will develop breast cancer in her life. In 2020, it is predicted that about 42,000 women in the United States are expected to die from breast cancer [5].

Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common form of breast cancer, representing over 80% of all cases [1]. In order to identify the type of cancer and its invasiveness, pathologists scan large sections of benign regions in order to identify malignant areas; this process can be time consuming and difficult [2]. Therefore, for our project, we will extract features from a dataset of breast histology images. After performing feature extraction we will use binary classification to determine the presence of IDC [4].

# DATASET AND PREPROCESSING

## **Dataset**
Our dataset is a Kaggle dataset provided by Paul Mooney. It consists of 277,524 breast histology images which originated from 162 whole mount Breast Cancer slide images [3].

Images in this dataset are of size 50x50x3. Each file name follows this format, which reveals if the image is cancerous images or not: u_xX_yY_classC.png => example 10253_idx5_x1351_y1101_class0.png.


- u : the patient ID (i.e. 10253_idx5)
- X : the x-coordinate of potential IDC (i.e. x1351)
- Y : the y-coordinate of potential IDC (i.e. y1101)
- C : the class where 0 is non-IDC and 1 is IDC [3]

### Example of the images:

![Examples of Dataset](./images/datasetExample.png)

## **Data Preprocessing**

We processed the data, and based on their class (0 for non-cancerous and 1 for cancerous), we were able to split our dataset. From this, we learned that these images contained 277524 total patches that we could analyze.

- `Total Image Patches:  277524`
- `Total Positive Patches:  78786`
- `Total Negative Patches:  198738`

### Results

A convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the most commonly used algorithms for image classification tasks. Using a CNN, we were able to achieve a recall of x percent and an accuracy of y percent. Before training our CNN on our data, there were several preprocessing steps that needed to occur.

One of the initial observations of the data was that the number of positive samples was significantly lower than the number of negative samples.

    </figure>
  </div>

The imbalanced class distributions will lead to our model generalizing poorly. This problem is exacerbated if we have unrepresentative test/train splits. In order to combat both the unbalanced class problem and increase the generalizability of our model, stratified k fold validation was used over 80% of the data. The other 20% is saved for testing. By using stratified k-fold validation, we ensure that each validation fold has an even proportion of positive and negative samples.

  </div>

The model was also improved by changing the color space of the input image. The RGB colorspace is a non-uniform colorspace, and it does not separate color from luminanceance like HSV or LUV do. The images are normalized and converted to the LUV colorspace as a result. LUV is perceptually linear and is therefore better for detecting color differences than RGB.

  After the data wrangling and preprocessing, the images were fed into a CNN with 7 convolution layers, 3 max pooling layers, a hidden dense layer, and an output layer. We also incorporated dropout layers into our model to help prevent overfitting the data.

The resulting learning curve shows the average loss and accuracy of the 5 validation folds plotted against the training data over 30 epochs. The recall chart was omitted because both the training and validation recall followed a strong logarithmic curve.

-- insert aforementioned curves --

From these charts, we can see that the validation loss is at a minimum at the x epoch and that the validation accuracy peaks at the y epoch. Because of this, the final model was trained over z epochs.

# Supervised Learning Models
### [linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, and neural network]
## Data Preprocessing
With such a large data set size, we were unable to run the dataset as is without our programs crashing. Therefore, e ran PCA on the data in order to reduce the number of variables in our dataset while maintaining as much information as possible. We were able to experiment with the results that we could obtain. In addition to the convolutional neural net, we ran other supervised learning models such as linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, and neural network. We utilized sklearn’s Kfold and split the dataset into 10 training tests. Then we used sklearn’s LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, Support Vector Machine SVC, DecisionTreeClassifier and compared their mean accuracies.
## Results
Across all 5 of these procedures, Support Vector Machine consistently had the highest accuracy values. However, SVM also took the longest to run compared to the other models. We plotted their results in box plots. The following represent their mean accuracies and corresponding standard deviations in parenthesis.
