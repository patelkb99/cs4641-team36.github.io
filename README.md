# MOTIVATION OF PROJECT

Breast cancer remains the second most common cancer diagnosis across the world while also disproportionately affecting women, and many types can show relatively few signs and symptoms. It is estimated that 1 in 8 women in the United States are at risk of developing breast cancer. In 2020, it is predicted that 42,000 women in the United States alone will die from this disease [5]. The inconspicuous nature of this disease along with its prevalence are powerful testaments to its deadliness, and in an effort to lessen its threat, we have decided to concentrate on how we could best identify the disease for faster and more effective treatment.

Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common type of breast cancer, representing over 80% of all cases [1]. In order to identify the type of cancer and its invasiveness, pathologists scan large sections of benign regions of tissue in order to identify malignant areas; however, this process can be time consuming and difficult [2]. With this issue in mind, we have decided to focus our efforts on extracting the characteristic features of IDC from a dataset of breast histology images using various machine learning techniques. Once we extract these features, we will use binary classification to determine if IDC is present, and then compare our methods to find the model with the highest accuracy that will also generalize best to real world applications.

# DATASET AND PREPROCESSING

## **Dataset**
Our dataset is a Kaggle dataset provided by Paul Mooney. It consists of 277,524 breast histology images which originated from 162 whole mount Breast Cancer slide images [3].

Images in this dataset are of size 50x50x3. Each file name follows this format, which reveals if the image is cancerous images or not: u_xX_yY_classC.png => example 10253_idx5_x1351_y1101_class0.png.


- u : the patient ID (i.e. 10253_idx5)
- X : the x-coordinate of potential IDC (i.e. x1351)
- Y : the y-coordinate of potential IDC (i.e. y1101)
- C : the class where 0 is non-IDC and 1 is IDC [3]

### Example of the images:

## **Data Preprocessing**

We processed and split our dataset based on their class (0 for no IDC present and 1 IDC present). The following are the ratios of negative to positive:

- `Total Image Patches:  277524`
- `Total Positive Patches:  78786`
- `Total Negative Patches:  198738`

# Methods

## **Convolutional Neural Network**

### Approach
We chose to use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting IDC because of its ability to perform feature extraction and classification. In addition, CNNs are currently one of the most popular models in the field of computer vision due to their ability to classify images with notably higher accuracy than other machine learning models. Using a CNN, we were able to achieve a recall of 70.3 percent and an accuracy of 87.51 percent.  

Before we could train our network, some data preprocessing tasks had to occur. 

One of the initial observations of the data was that the number of positive samples was much lower than the number of negative samples, as shown in Graph 1. The imbalanced class distributions will lead to our model generalizing poorly. This problem is exacerbated if we have unrepresentative test/train splits. In order to combat the unbalanced class problem and increase the generalizability of our model, we used stratified k-fold validation over 80% of the data. The other 20% was saved for testing. By using stratified k-fold validation, we ensured that each validation fold had an even proportion of positive and negative samples.

  <br>
  <em>Graph 2. Ratio of Negative to Positive Samples Five Folds</em>
</p>

The model was also improved by changing the color space of the input image. The RGB colorspace is a non-uniform colorspace, and it does not separate color from luminance like HSV or LUV do. The images are normalized and converted to the LUV colorspace as a result. LUV is perceptually linear and is therefore better for detecting color differences than RGB.

  <br>
  <em>Image 3. Color Space Modification: LUV</em>
</p>

### The CNN Architecture
After the data wrangling and preprocessing, the images were fed into a CNN with seven convolution layers, three max pooling layers, a hidden dense layer, and an output layer. We also incorporated dropout layers into our model to help prevent overfitting the data.

<p align="center">
  <img class="cen" src="images/CNNlayers.png" />
  <br>
  <em>Image 4. Visualization of Graphics Layers</em>
</p>

The resulting learning curve shows the average loss and accuracy of the five validation folds plotted against the training data over 30 epochs. The recall chart was omitted because both the training and validation recall followed a strong logarithmic curve.

</p>
<p align="center">
  <img class="cen" src="images/losscurve.png" />
  <br>
  <em>Graph 4. Loss Curve Across Five Validation Folds</em>
</p>

From these charts, we can see that both the validation loss and validation accuracy peak at the 16th epoch. The model is then trained on the full 80% training split over 16 epochs. 

### Improving The Results

There are several things that could be implemented that might result in an increase in recall or accuracy. First, is randomly oversampling the positive samples. Since the model prioritizes recall over accuracy, it is more important that a positive sample is labeled as positive than that the model predicts both classes equally. With more positive image samples in each of the validation folds, it is more likely a positive image is label correctly.

The CNN architecture could also improve. With more time and experimentation, we potentially could have performed more experimentation with the layers of our model. Additionally, if there were more available computational resources, more hyperparameter tuning could occur. As previously mentioned, the validation recall continually increased with the training recall. The key issue is balancing the recall precision tradeoff. 

## Supervised Learning Models
### Linear Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network

In addition to the convolutional neural net, we ran other supervised learning models: Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree Classifier (DTC). We utilized sklearn’s Kfold and split the dataset into ten training tests. Then we used sklearn’s LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, Support Vector Machine SVC, DecisionTreeClassifier and compared their mean accuracies. We ran these methods twice: first on the dataset without preprocessing and then once again on a dataset that we had preprocessed with PCA.

### Data Preprocessing
First, we split the dataset into a training and testing set with an 80-20 split respectively. With such a large dataset size, we wanted to observe what would happen to our results and processing time if we ran PCA on the data. By using PCA, we would be able to reduce the number of features in our dataset while maintaining as much information as possible. We used a 95% variance. This data can be visualized in the scree plot below.

</p>

### Results

In the dataset without PCA, on average, KNN, RF, and SVM had relatively similar average accuracies across the 10 folds. However, SVM had the highest average accuracy with the best accuracy being above 85%, but this test also took the longest to process.

In the dataset with PCA, SVM also had the highest average accuracy, with KNN as the second best by approximately 4%. Once again, SVM took longer than any other method to complete.

The average accuracies and their standard deviations for our supervised learning models both with and without PCA follow: 

#### `No PCA`
- `RF: 0.831286 (0.011019)`
- `KNN: 0.802857 (0.011429)`
- `SVM: 0.838286 (0.014802)`
- `DTC: 0.752429 (0.013141)`
- `LR: 0.688857 (0.013788)`

- `SVM: 0.839571 (0.014358)`
- `DTC: 0.743429 (0.019527)`
- `LR: 0.687286 (0.016592)`

### Discussion
Initially, we expected methods which ran on the dataset with PCA to have a higher accuracy level because such a dataset would necessarily include less noise. However, as shown in our results, the methods which we ran on the dataset without PCA had better accuracies in general. One reason for this occurence may be that PCA does not take into consideration the prediction target. This would decrease accuracy because while PCA is reducing noise in the dataset, it may also remove regions critical to determining the prediction target.
